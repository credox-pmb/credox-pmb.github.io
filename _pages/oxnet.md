Pembroke College, Oxford, seeks to inspire and nurture a spirit of lifelong learning and enquiry in line with our statutes providing â€˜education for the common good'. We encourage pupils from diverse backgrounds to apply to the UK's top universities including Oxford and Pembroke. Much of our outreach work is carried out under our OxNet banner.
