  abstract={It is well known that artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, has the potential for hugely beneficial impacts on all areas of life, but also carries with it dangers such as lack of transparency, over-rigidity of decision-making, negative feedback loops and unreasonable inferences. Such dangers also have the potential to be scaled across a whole area of decisions. There is, therefore, an increasing sense that we need greater accountability of algorithmic decision-making systems and it is argued here that public law and the grounds of judicial review are a ready-made toolkit specifically designed to render decision-makers accountable and to make precisely the kinds of trade-offs we will need to make between effectiveness and efficiency on the one hand and fairness on the other. These tools can therefore provide a blueprint as we work out how to govern ADM and render it accountable, even in a private context. This can take place by using the public law toolkit in interpreting existing legislation, informing future regulation and even through the exercise of a common law supervisory jurisdiction.}

  abstract={Molecular dynamics are essential for protein function. In some cases these dynamics involve the interconversion between ground state, highly populated conformers and less populated higher energy structures ('excited states') that play critical roles in biochemical processes. Here we describe recent advances in NMR spectroscopy methods that enable studies of these otherwise invisible excited states at an atomic level and that help elucidate their important relation to function. We discuss a range of examples from molecular recognition, ligand binding, enzyme catalysis and protein folding that illustrate the role that motion plays in 'funneling' conformers along preferred pathways that facilitate their biological function.}

  abstract={The mechanical properties of polymers are becoming increasingly important as they are used in structural applications, both on their own and as matrix materials for composites. It has long been known that these mechanical properties are dependent on strain rate, temperature, and pressure. In this paper, the methods for dynamic loading of polymers will be briefly reviewed. The high strain rate mechanical properties of several classes of polymers, i.e. glassy and rubbery amorphous polymers and semi-crystalline polymers will be reviewed. Additionally, timeâ€“temperature superposition for rate dependent large strain properties and pressure dependence in polymers will be discussed. Constitutive modeling and shock properties of polymers will not be discussed in this review.}
