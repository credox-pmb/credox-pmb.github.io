Prof Andrew Baldwin runs a biomolecular NMR research group based in the Department of Chemistry. His primary focus is in the biophysical basis of function, and malfunction, of proteins in health and disease. He combines advanced solution and solids NMR spectroscopy techniques with complementary methods such as ion-mobility mass spectrometry and electron microscopy in order to study the structure and dynamics of proteins, and relate this to their behaviour in the cell.
