Dr Nicholas Cole is a Senior Research Fellow at Pembroke College and the director of the [Quill Project](www.quill.pmb.ox.ac.uk), one of the College's research centres. His studies revolve around American legal history, the evolution of modern political thought, the reception of classics in the contemporary world, and the development of digital techniques and methodologies that can facilitate humanities research. His interest is not purely antiquarian: the debate over 'what is the best form of government?' has been rekindled in recent years, and there is no universal consensus that liberal democracy with robust protection of individual rights is the answer. Therefore, deepening our understanding of the history of our institutions and the thoughts that constructed them has never seemed more critical.
